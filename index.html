 <h2> Foreword </h2>

<p>
 It is a significant fact that nearly all Ford cars are driven by
 laymen--by owners, who in the great majority of cases have little
 or no practical experience with things mechanical. 
</p>
<p>
 The simplicity of the Ford car and the ease with which it
 is operated renders an intimate knowledge of mechanical
 technicalities unnecessary for its operation. 
</p>
<p>
 And the further fact that there are more than twenty thousand Ford
 service stations distributed throughout the civilized world--where
 adjustments and repairs may be had with no annoying delay--gives
 to Ford owners a singular freedom from mechanical annoyances
 which beset owners of cars having limited service facilities and
 distribution.
</p>
<p>
 But while it is not imperative, it is, however, altogether
 desirable that every Ford owner should thoroughly understand his
 car. With such knowledge at his command he is always master of the
 situation--he will maintain his car more economically--prolong its
 usefulness--and he will also derive more pleasure from it, for it
 is a truism that the more one knows about a thing the more one
 enjoys it.
</p>
<p>
 The mastery of a thorough knowledge of Ford construction is by no
 means a difficult or time-consuming task. The Ford is the simplest
 car made. It is easy to understand, and is not difficult to keep
 in proper adjustment and repair.
</p>
<p>
 That the Ford construction may be thoroughly understood--and
 that there may be an authoritative guide for the making of Ford
 adjustments--this book is published.
</p>

<h4> Important </h4>
<p>
 _It is most important that owners of Ford cars shall insist upon
 getting the genuine Ford-made materials, or "Parts," when having
 repairs or replacements made. This will be assured when the car
 is taken to the authorized Ford agent. Imitation, or "bogus" or
 counterfeit parts of inferior quality are being made and sold as
 "Ford Parts." Avoid their use by dealing with the authorised Ford
 agent._
</p>



<h2> The Car and Its Operation </h2>


<h3> _What must be done before starting the Car?_ </h3>         
<h4>_Answer No. 1_</h4> 
<p>
 Before trying to start the car, fill the radiator (by removing cap
 at top) with clean fresh water. If perfectly clean water cannot
 be obtained it is advisable to strain it through muslin or other
 similar material to prevent foreign matter from getting in and
 obstructing the small tubes of the radiator. The system will hold
 approximately three gallons. It is important that the car should
 not be run under its own power unless the water circulating system
 has been filled. Pour in the water until you are sure that both
 radiator and cylinder water jackets are full. The water will run
 out of the overflow pipe onto the ground when the entire water
 system has been properly filled. During the first few days that a
 new car is being driven it is a good plan to examine the radiator
 frequently and see that it is kept properly filled. The water
 supply should be replenished as often as may be found necessary.
 Soft rain water, when it is to be had in a clean state, is
 superior to hard water, which may contain alkalies and other salts
 which tend to deposit sediment and clog the radiator. (See chapter
 on Cooling System.)
</p>

<h3> _What about Gasoline?_ </h3>                               
<h4>_Answer No. 2_ </h4>
<p>
 The ten-gallon gasoline tank should be filled--nearly full--and
 the supply should never be allowed to get low. When filling the
 tank be sure that there are no naked flames within several feet,
 as the vapor is extremely volatile and travels rapidly. Always
 be careful about lighting matches near where gasoline has been
 spilled, as the air within a radius of several feet is permeated
 with the highly explosive vapor. The small vent hole in the
 gasoline tank cap should not be allowed to get plugged up, as
 this would prevent proper flow of the gasoline to the carburetor.
 The gasoline tank may be drained by opening the pet cock in the
 sediment bulb at the bottom.
</p>

<h3> _How about the Oiling System?_ </h3>                      
<h4>_Answer No. 3_ </h4>
<p>
 Upon receipt of the car see that a supply of medium light,
 high-grade gas engine oil is poured into the crank case through
 the breather pipe at the front of the engine (a metal cap covers
 it). Down under the car in the flywheel casing (the reservoir
 which holds this oil) you will find two pet cocks. Pour oil in
 slowly until it runs out of the upper cock. Leave the cock open
 until it stops running--then close it. After the engine has
 become thoroughly limbered up, the best results will be obtained
 by carrying the oil at a level midway between the two cocks--but
 under no circumstances should it be allowed to get below the lower
 cock. All other parts of the car are properly oiled when it leaves
 the factory. However, it will be well to see that all grease cups
 are filled and that oil is supplied to necessary parts. (See Cut
 No. 18, also chapter on Lubrication.)
</p>

<h3> _How are Spark and Throttle Levers used?_ </h3>           
<h4>_Answer No. 4_ </h4>
<p>
Under the steering wheel are two small levers. The right-hand
(throttle) lever controls the amount of mixture (gasoline and air)
which goes into the engine. When the engine is in operation, the
farther this lever is moved downward toward the driver (referred
to as "opening the throttle") the faster the engine runs and the
greater the power furnished. The left-hand lever controls the
spark, which explodes the gas in the cylinders of the engine. The
advancing of this lever "advances the spark," and it should
be moved down notch by notch until the motor seems to reach its
maximum speed. If the lever is advanced beyond this point a dull
knock will be noticed in the engine. (See chapter on Ignition.)
</p>
 [Illustration: Steering Wheel, showing reduction gears meshing
 with the teeth of the gear case and center pinion. (Cut No. 1)]


<h3> _Where should these levers be when starting the Engine?_ </h3>
<h4>_Answer No. 5_ </h4>
<p>
 The spark lever should usually be put in about the third or fourth
 notch of the quadrant (the notched half-circle on which the levers
 operate). The throttle should usually be opened about five or
 six notches. A little experience will soon teach you where these
 levers should be placed for proper starting. Care should be taken
 not to advance the spark lever too far, as the engine may "back
 kick."
</p>

<h3> _What else is necessary before starting the Engine?_ </h4>
<h4>_Answer No. 6_ </h4>
<p>
 First, see that the hand lever, which comes up through the floor
 of the car at the left of the driver, is pulled back as far as it
 will go. The lever in this position holds the clutch in neutral
 and engages the hub brake, thus preventing the car moving forward
 when the engine is started. Second, after inserting the switch key
 in the switch on the coil box, throw the switch lever as far to
 the left as it will go--to the point marked "magneto." This switch
 connects the magneto with the engine. The engine can't be started
 until it is on--and the throwing off of this switch stops the
 engine.
</p>

<h3> _How is the Engine started?_ </h3>                         
<h4>_Answer No. 7_ </h4>
<p>
 If the car is not equipped with a starter the engine is started
 by the lifting of the starting crank at the front of the car.
 Take hold of the handle and push firmly toward the car till you
 feel the crank ratchet engage, then lift upward with a quick
 swing. With a little experience this operation wall become an
 easy matter. Don't, as a usual thing, crank downward against the
 compression--for then an early explosion may drive the handle
 vigorously backward. This does not mean however, that it is not
 advisable, when the car is hard to start, to occasionally "spin"
 the engine by the use of the starting handle--but be sure the
 spark lever is retarded when spinning or cranking the engine
 against compression, otherwise a sudden backfire may injure the
 arm of the operator. When the engine is cool it is advisable to
 prime the carburetor by pulling on the small wire at the lower
 left corner of the radiator while giving the engine two or three
 quarter turns with the starting handle.
 </p>
<p>
 If the car is equipped with a starter the spark and throttle
 levers should be placed in the same position on the quadrant as
 when cranking by hand, and the ignition switch turned on. Current
 from either battery or magneto may be used for ignition. However,
 we recommend that the magneto be used at all times. The magneto
 was designed to furnish ignition for the Model T engine and
 better results will be obtained by operating in this way. Special
 attention must be paid to the position of the spark lever as a
 too advanced spark will cause serious backfiring which in turn
 will bend or break the shaft in the starter. The starting motor is
 operated by a push button, conveniently located in the floor of
 the car at the driver's feet. With the spark and throttle levers
 in the proper position, and the ignition switch turned on, press
 on the push button with the foot. This closes the circuit between
 the battery and starting motor, causing the pinion of the Bendix
 drive shaft to engage with the teeth on the flywheel, thus turning
 over the crankshaft. When the engine is cold it may be necessary
 to prime it by pulling out the carburetor priming rod, which is
 located on the instrument board. In order to avoid flooding the
 engine with an over rich mixture of gas, the priming rod should
 only be held out for a few seconds at a time.
</p>

<h3> _How is the Engine best started in cold weather?_ </h3>    
<h4>_Answer No. 8_ </h4>
<p>
 As gasoline does not vaporize readily in cold weather it is
 naturally more difficult to start the motor under such conditions.
 The usual method of starting the engine when cold is to turn
 the carburetor dash adjustment one-quarter turn to the left in
 order to allow a richer mixture of gasoline to be drawn into the
 cylinders; then hold out the priming rod, while you turn crank
 from six to eight one-quarter turns in quick succession, or turn
 the motor over a few times with the starter. Another method of
 starting a troublesome cold engine is as follows: Before you throw
 on the magneto switch, (1) close throttle lever; (2) hold out
 priming rod while you give crank several quick turns, or turn the
 motor over a few times with the starter, then let go of priming
 rod (being careful that it goes back all the way); (3) place spark
 lever in about third notch and advance throttle lever several
 notches; (4) throw on switch (being sure to get it on side marked
 "Magneto"); (5) give crank one or two turns, or close the starting
 switch, and the motor should start. After starting the motor it
 is advisable to advance the spark eight or ten notches on the
 quadrant and let the motor run until thoroughly heated up. If you
 start out with a cold motor you will not have much power and are
 liable to "stall." The advantage of turning on the switch last, or
 after priming, is that when you throw on the switch and start the
 motor, you have plenty of gas in the cylinders, to keep the motor
 running, thereby eliminating the trouble of the motor starting and
 stopping. After motor is warmed up turn carburetor adjustment back
 one-quarter turn.
</p>
<p>
 To facilitate starting many drivers make a practice of stopping
 their engine by pulling out on the priming rod, which has the
 effect of shutting off the air suction and filling the cylinders
 full of a very rich gasoline vapor. This should not be done unless
 the car is going to stand over night or long enough to cool off.
 If the motor is stopped in this way and then started when hot,
 starting is apt to be difficult on account of the surplus gasoline
 in the carburetor.
</p>

<h3> _What function does the Hand Lever perform?_ </h3>         
<h4>_Answer No. 9_ </h4>
<p>
 Its chief purpose is to hold the clutch in neutral position. If it
 were not for this lever the driver would have to stop the engine
 whenever he left the driver's seat. He would also be unable to
 crank the engine without the car starting forward with the first
 explosion. When pulled back as far as it will go, the hand lever
 acts as an emergency brake on the rear wheels, by expanding the
 brake shoes in the rear wheel drums. Therefore the hand lever
 should be back as far as it will go when cranking the engine or
 when the car is at rest. It should be only in a vertical position,
 and not far enough backward to act as a brake on the rear wheels,
 when the car is to be reversed. When the car is operating in high
 or low speed the hand lever should be all the way forward.
</p>

<h3> _How do the Foot Pedals operate?_ </h3>                   
<h4>_Answer No. 10_</h4>
<p>
 The first one toward the left operates the clutch. When pressed
 forward the clutch pedal engages the low speed. When half-way
 forward the clutch is in neutral (i. e., disconnected from the
 driving mechanism of the rear wheels), and the releasing of this
 pedal engages the high-speed clutch. The center pedal operates the
 reverse. The right-hand pedal operates the transmission brake.
</p>

<h3> _How is the Car started?_ </h3>                           
<h4>_Answer No. 11_ </h4>
<p>
 Slightly accelerate the engine by opening the throttle, press
 the clutch pedal half way forward, thereby holding the clutch in
 a neutral position while throwing the hand lever forward; then
 press the pedal forward into slow speed and when under sufficient
 headway (20 to 30 feet), allow the pedal to drop back slowly into
 high speed, at the same time partially closing the throttle,
 which will allow the engine to pick up its load easily. With a
 little practice, the change of speeds will be easily accomplished,
 and without any appreciable effect on the smooth running of the
 machine.
</p>

<h3> _How is the Car stopped?_ </h3>                           
<h4>_Answer No. 12_ </h4>
<p>
 Partially close the throttle; release the high speed by pressing
 the clutch pedal forward into neutral; apply the foot brake slowly
 but firmly until the car comes to a dead stop. Do not remove foot
 from the clutch pedal without first pulling the hand lever back
 to neutral position, or the engine will stall. To stop the motor,
 open the throttle a trifle to accelerate the motor and then throw
 off the switch. The engine will then stop with the cylinders full
 of explosive gas, which will naturally facilitate starting.
</p>
<p>
 Endeavor to so familiarize yourself with the operation of the
 car that to disengage the clutch and apply the brake becomes
 practically automatic--the natural thing to do in case of
 emergency.
</p>

<h3> _How is the Car reversed?_ </h3>                          
<h4>_Answer No. 13_ </h4>
<p>
 It must be brought to a dead stop. With the engine running,
 disengage the clutch with the hand lever and press the reverse
 pedal forward with the left foot, the right foot being free to use
 on the brake pedal if needed. Do not bring the hand lever back too
 far or you will set the brakes on rear wheels. Experienced drivers
 ordinarily reverse the car by simply holding the clutch pedal in
 neutral with the left foot, and operating the reverse pedal with
 the right.
</p>

<h3> _How is the Spark controlled?_ </h3>                      
<h4>_Answer No. 14_</h4>
<p>
 By the left-hand lever under the steering wheel. Good operators
 drive with the spark lever advanced just as far as the engine will
 permit. However, advancing the spark too far will cause a dull
 knock in the motor, due to the fact that the explosion occurs too
 early. The spark should only be retarded when the engine slows
 down on a heavy road or steep grade, but care should be exercised
 not to retard the spark too far as this will result in late
 ignition, which causes loss of power and overheating of the motor
 and may also result in warped, burned or cracked valves. Learn to
 operate the spark as the occasion demands. The greatest economy
 in gasoline consumption is obtained by driving with the spark
 advanced sufficiently to obtain the maximum speed.
</p>

<h3> _How is speed of Car controlled?_ </h3>                   
<h4>_Answer No. 15_ </h4>
<p>
 The different speeds required to meet road conditions are obtained
 by opening or closing the throttle. Practically all the running
 speeds needed for ordinary travel are obtained on high gear, and
 it is seldom necessary to use the low gear except to give the car
 momentum in starting. The speed of the car may be temporarily
 slackened in driving through crowded traffic, turning corners,
 etc., by "slipping the clutch," i. e., pressing the clutch pedal
 forward into neutral.
</p>

<h3> _Is it advisable for owners to make their own Adjustments?_ </h3>
<h4>_Answer No. 16_ </h4>
<p>
 The Ford is the simplest of all cars. Most of the ordinary
 adjustments an owner will soon learn to make for himself. But
 we must strongly recommend that when it becomes necessary
 to employ the services of a mechanic, the car be taken to a
 Ford mechanic--one of our own representatives who thoroughly
 understands the car--and who will have no motive for running up
 useless repair bills. The entire Ford organization is interested
 in keeping every individual Ford car in constant operation, at the
 lowest possible cost. We have known of much damage done to many
 cars by unskilled repair men.
</p>

<h3> _What attention does the Car need?_ </h3>                 
<h4>_Answer No. 17_ </h4>
<p>
 Remember that a new machine requires more careful attention during
 the first few days it is being driven than after the parts have
 become thoroughly "worked in." The car which is driven slowly and
 carefully when new usually gives the most satisfactory service in
 the end. Never start out with your car until you are sure that
 is has plenty of oil and water. Frequently inspect the running
 gear. See that no unnecessary play exists in either front or rear
 wheels, and that all bolts and nuts are tight. Make a practice of
 taking care of every repair or adjustment as soon as its necessity
 is discovered. This attention requires but little time and may
 avoid delay or possible accident on the road. We aim to deliver
 the car in proper mechanical adjustment. Afterwards it is plainly
 the duty of the driver to keep it in that condition.
</p>



<h2> The Ford Engine </h2>


<h3> _What is the principle of the gasoline-driven Engine?_ </h3>
<h4>_Answer No. 18_ </h4>
<p>
 Gasoline when mixed with air and compressed is highly explosive.
 An explosion is a violent expansion caused by instantaneous
 combustion of confined gases. In the gasoline engine the mixture
 is drawn into a cylinder, where it is compressed by an advancing
 piston and then exploded by an electric spark, which sends the
 piston downward, and through the connecting rod imparts a rotary
 motion to the crankshaft. (See Cut No. 2.)
</p>

<h3> _What are the functions of the Pistons?_ </h3>            
<h4>_Answer No. 19_ </h4>
<p>
 On the downward stroke the suction of the piston draws the fresh
 gas from the carburetor, through the inlet pipe and valve, into
 the cylinder. The upward movement of the piston compresses the
 gas into a very small space, between the top of the piston and
 the depression in the cylinder head, known as the "combustion
 chamber." (The compressed gases exert a pressure of approximately
 60 pounds per square inch.) At this point the electric spark,
 generated by the magneto, explodes the gases--driving the piston
 downward--thus producing the power which turns the crank shaft.
 On the next stroke upward the piston drives the exploded gas out
 through the exhaust valve and pipe to the muffler. (See Cut No. 3.)
</p>

<h3> _Connecting Rod--how removed?_ </h3>                      
<h4>_Answer No. 20_ </h4>
<p>
 It is a steel rod, connecting piston and crank shaft. Should the
 babbitt bearing become worn, or burned out through lack of oil,
 a knocking in the engine will result in which case the entire
 connecting rod should be replaced. To make this replacement,
 (1) drain oil from crank case; (2) take off cylinder head; (3)
 remove detachable plate on bottom of crank case; (4) disconnect
 connecting rod from crank shaft; (5) take piston and rod out
 through top of cylinder.
</p>

<h3> _What is the Valve Arrangement?_ </h3>                   
<h4>_Answer No. 21_ </h4>
<p>
 One intake and one exhaust valve are located in each cylinder.
 The former admits the fresh gas drawn from the carburetor through
 the inlet pipe--the latter permits the exploded gas to be driven
 out through the exhaust pipe. The valves are alternately opened
 and closed (see Cut No. 3) by the cams on the cam shaft striking
 against push rods which in turn lift the valves from their seats.
</p>

<h3> _What about Valve timing?_ </h3>                          
<h4>_Answer No. 22_ </h4>
<p>
 In timing the engine the points of opening and closing of the
 valves are, of course, what should be considered. As the valves
 are properly timed at the factory when the engine is built the
 necessity for retiming would occur only when such parts as the cam
 shaft, time gears or valves were removed in overhauling the engine.
</p>
 [Illustration: Sectional View of the Model T Motor. (Cut No. 2)]

 [Illustration: Cylinder Assembly, showing the correct position of
 the valves with time gears properly set according to punch marks
 on the gears, also the relative position of the pistons in their
 strokes as indicated above. The firing order of the cylinders is
 1, 2, 4, 3. (Cut No. 3)]
<p>
 In fitting the large time gear to the cam shaft it is important to
 see that the first cam points in a direction opposite to the zero
 mark (see Cut No. 3). The time gears must also mesh so that the
 tooth marked zero (0) on the small time gear will come between the
 two teeth on the large gear at the zero point. The time gears now
 being properly set, the exhaust valve on No. 1 cylinder is open and
 the intake valve closed, the other valves being in the position
 indicated in Cut No. 3. The opening and closing of the valves being
 as follows: The exhaust valve opens when the piston reaches 5/16"
 of bottom center, the distance from the top of the piston head to
 the top of cylinder casting measuring 3-3/8". The exhaust valve will
 close on top centre, the piston being 5/16" above the cylinder
 casting. The intake valve opens 1/16" after top center, and closes
 9/16" after bottom center, the distance from the top of the piston
 to the top of the cylinder casting measuring 3-1/8".
</p>
 [Illustration: How the valve lifting tool should be used. (Cut No. 4)]
<p>
 The clearance between the push rod and valve stem should never be
 greater than 1/32" nor less than 1/64". The correct clearance is
 naturally half way between these two measurements. The gap should
 be measured when the push rod is on the heel of the cam.
</p>

<h3> _What about the care of the Valves?_ </h3>               
<h4>_Answer No. 23_ </h4>
<p>
 They seldom get out of order--but they do get dirty, as a result
 of carbon collecting on the valve seats. These carbon deposits by
 preventing proper closing of the valves, permit the gases under
 compression to escape, resulting in loss of power and uneven
 running of the motor. If, when turning the engine over slowly,
 there is a lack of resistance in one or more cylinders, it is
 probable that the valves need re-grinding. As the "life" of the
 engine depends largely upon the proper seating of the valves, it
 is necessary that they be ground occasionally.

<h3> _How are Valves removed for grinding?_ </h3>              
<h4>_Answer No. 24_ </h4>
<p>
 (1) Drain radiator; (2) remove cylinder head; (3) remove the two
 valve covers on the right side of engine; (4) raise the valve
 spring with lifting tool (see Cut No. 4) and pull out the little
 pin under the valve seat. The valve may then be lifted out by the
 head.

<h3> _How are Valves ground?_ </h3>                            
<h4>_Answer No. 25_ </h4>
<p>
 For this work use a good grinding paste of ground glass and
 oil--procurable from auto supply houses. A convenient way is to
 put a small amount in a suitable dish, adding a spoonful or two of
 kerosene and a few drops of lubricating oil to make a thin paste.
</p>
 [Illustration: Method of grinding valve. (Cut No. 5)]
<p>
 Place the mixture sparingly on the bevel face of the valve. Put
 the valve in position on the valve seat, and rotate it back and
 forth (about a quarter turn) a few times, with a Ford grinding
 tool. Then lift slightly from the seat, change the position and
 continue the rotation, and keep on repeating this operation until
 the bearing surface is smooth and bright. The valve should not
 be turned through a complete revolution, as this is apt to cause
 scratches running around the entire circumference of the valve and
 seat. When the grinding is completed the valve should be removed
 from the cylinder, thoroughly washed with kerosene, and the valve
 seat wiped out thoroughly. Extreme care should be taken that no
 abrasive substance gets into the cylinders or valve guides. This
 can be avoided if the grinding paste is applied sparingly to
 the bevel face of the valve. If the valve seat is worn badly or
 seamed, it is best to have it reseated with a valve seating tool.
 This operation requires considerable skill, and perhaps had better
 be done by an expert mechanic. Care should be exercised against
 making too deep a cut, necessitating the retiming of the valve.

<h3> _When the Valves and Push Rods are worn--what?_ </h3>     
<h4>_Answer No. 26_ </h4>
<p>
 When the valves or push rods become worn, so as to leave too
 much play between them, thus reducing the lift of the valves and
 diminishing the power of the motor, it is best to replace the push
 rods with new ones. The clearance between the push rods and the
 valve stem should never be greater than 1/32" nor less than 1/64".
 If the clearance is greater, the valve will open late and close
 early, resulting in uneven running of the motor. If the clearance
 is less than 1/64" there is danger of the valve remaining
 partially open all the time. If replacing the push rod does not
 give the proper clearance, the valve should also be replaced. We
 do not recommend drawing out the valve stem, as the operation
 requires experience and the price of the new part does not warrant
 the time and expense necessary to properly do the work.

<h3> _What about the Valve Springs?_ <h3>                     
<h4>_Answer No. 27_ </h4>
<p>
 When the valves fail to seat themselves properly, there is a
 possibility that the springs may be weak or broken. A weak inlet
 spring would probably not affect the running of the engine, but
 weakness in the exhaust valve spring causes a very uneven action,
 which is difficult to locate. The symptoms area lag in the engine
 due to the exhaust valve not closing instantaneously, and as
 a result a certain percentage of the charge under compression
 escapes, greatly diminishing the force of the explosion. Weakness
 in a valve spring can usually be detected by the following method:
 Remove the plate which encloses them at the side of the cylinder
 and insert a screw driver between the coils of the spring while
 the engine is running. If the extra tension thus produced causes
 the engine to pick up speed, the spring is obviously weak and
 should be replaced with a new one.

<h3> _What cause "Knocking" in the Engine?_ </h3>              
<h4>_Answer No. 28_ </h4>
<p>
 There are several causes, which may be enumerated as follows: (1)
 carbon knock--which is by far the most common--resulting from
 carbonizing of cylinders; (2) knock caused by a too advanced
 spark; (3) connecting rod knock; (4) crank shaft main bearing
 knock; (5) knock due to loose-fitting piston or broken ring; (6)
 knock caused by the piston striking the cylinder head gasket.
 When the engine knocks from any cause whatsoever, the matter
 should be promptly investigated by an experienced mechanic and the
 difficulty corrected.
</p>

<h3> _How may the different Knocks be distinguished?_ </h3>    
<h4>_Answer No. 29_ </h4>
<p>
 (1) The carbon knock is a clear, hollow sound, most noticeable in
 climbing sharp grades, particularly when the engine is heated.
 It is also indicated by a sharp rap immediately on advancing the
 throttle. (2) Too advanced spark will be indicated by a dull knock
 in the motor. (3) The connecting rod knock sounds like the distant
 tapping of steel with a small hammer, and is readily distinguished
 when the car is allowed to run idly down grade--or upon speeding
 the car to twenty-five miles an hour, then suddenly closing the
 throttle, the tapping will be very distinct. (4) The crank shaft
 main bearing knock can be distinguished, when the car is going
 uphill, as a dull thud. (5) The loose piston knock is heard only
 upon suddenly opening the throttle, when the sound produced might
 be likened to a rattle. The remedies for these knocks are treated
 under their proper division.

<h3> _How is carbon removed from Combustion Chamber?_ </h3>    
<h4>_Answer No. 30_ </h4>
<p>
 First, drain the water off by opening the pet cock at the bottom
 of the radiator; then disconnect the wires at the top of the motor
 and also the radiator connection attached to the radiator. Remove
 the 15 cap screws which hold the cylinder head in place. Take off
 the cylinder head and, with a putty knife or screw driver, scrape
 the carbonized matter from the cylinder head and top of pistons,
 being careful to prevent the specks of carbon from getting into
 the cylinders or bolt holes. In replacing the cylinder head gasket
 turn the motor over so that No. 1 and No. 4 pistons are at top
 center; place the gasket in position over the pistons and then put
 the cylinder head in place. Be sure and draw the cylinder head
 bolts down evenly (i. e., give each bolt a few turns at a time);
 do not tighten them on one end before drawing them up at the other.
